For this assignment you will be creating Version One of your Final Project using Fat-free and MVC, as well as GitHub.

Begin by creating a private GitHub repo for your project. Add me and your teammate(s) as Collaborators. I will be looking for a clear history of commits from all team members.

Version One requirements:
<br>--Fat-free is utilized correctly.
<br>--The site has a title and favicon.
<br>--A home page makes it clear what the project is about, and includes at least one image.
<br>--Routing is enabled and works properly. A second page is accessible from the home page.
<br>--Bootstrap is used for layout.
<br>--HTML is valid.  https://html5.validator.nu/
<br>--There is a clear separation of concerns.
<br>--Files are organized into appropriate directories, including view, images, styles, etc.
<br>--Files you created are under version control. Files you did not create are not under version control. GitHub comments are clear.
<br>--Code is well-commented and code style (variable names, curly braces, etc.) is consistent.
